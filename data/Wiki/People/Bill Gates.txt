William Henry "Bill" Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, and
 philanthropist. In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software
 company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, and
 was the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. Gates has authored and co-authored several books.
 Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people and was the wealthiest from
 1995 to 2007, again in 2009, and has been since 2014. Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to
 more than US$82 billion. Between 2013 and 2014, his wealth increased by US$15 billion. Gates is currently the
 richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$85.6 billion as of February 2017.
 Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his
 business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion that has in some cases been upheld by
 numerous court rulings. Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large
 amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.
 Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the
 position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from
 full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He
 gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology adviser to support the then newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
